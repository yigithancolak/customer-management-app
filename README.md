## App Tutorial Video
In my application, user-friendly features enable you to establish and manage customer groups effortlessly. Within these groupings, you can maintain each customer's individual details. A distinguishing aspect of this application is the color-coded system for customer payment status: if a customer's next payment is due, their name will be highlighted in red. In contrast, if their payment status is current, their name will appear in green. This simple visual cue enhances usability and efficiency in keeping track of payment statuses.
